google-homepage-clone
=====================

Clone of Google's homepage.

This is a project I compleated as a student in Thinkful's Front End Web Development Program. We were tasked with recreating the Google homepage from scratch, without looking at the source code of the homepage. Everything had to be recreated by looking at this page, the same as if we were looking at a design/.psd that we had to code. 

This was the second project in the FEWD Program.
